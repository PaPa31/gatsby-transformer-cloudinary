# gatsby-transformer-cloudinary

Creates `CloudinaryAsset` nodes from compatible `File` nodes. The `File` nodes are uploaded to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), and the `CloudinaryAsset` responses are made up of Cloudinary URLs to transformed images in a format that‘s compatible with [`gatsby-image`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/).

You’ll need a [Cloudinary account](https://cloudinary.com) to use this plugin. They have a generous free tier, so for most of us this will stay free for quite a while.

[Live demo](https://gatsby-transformer-cloudinary.netlify.com/) ([source](https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary))

> **DISCLAIMER:** If you try running this demo's source code on your own computer, you might face issues as the demo uses assets and [transformations](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/chained_and_named_transformations#named_transformations) from the author’s Cloudinary account. Before running, please remove them or replace them with images and transformations from your own Cloudinary account.

## Features

- Upload local project media assets to a secure remote CDN
- Upload remote media assets to a secure remote CDN
- Utilize media assets on Cloudinary in gatsby-image
- Use gatsby-image `fluid` and `fixed` formats on Cloudinary assets
- Retrieve media files in optimized formats with responsive breakpoints
- Utilize all Cloudinary transformations including chained transformations in gatsby's data layer

## Example usage

Here's the plugin in action to fetch a fixed asset using the `useStaticQuery` API of gatsby:

```jsx harmony
import React from 'react';
import { graphql, useStaticQuery } from 'gatsby';
import Image from 'gatsby-image';

export default () => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      file(name: { eq: "marketplace-banner" }) {
        childCloudinaryAsset {
          fixed {
            ...CloudinaryAssetFixed
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Here goes something</h2>
      <Image fixed={data.file.childCloudinaryAsset.fixed} alt="banner" />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Installation

This transformer automatically creates childCloudinaryAsset nodes for `File` nodes created by [`gatsby-source-filesystem`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/).

This transformer also allows you to pass URLs directly to Cloudinary to side-step the need to first download files to your development machine. This can be achieved by calling the `createRemoteImageNode` function from an `onCreateNode` function.

Install the plugins using either `npm` or `yarn`.

```sh
npm install --save gatsby-transformer-cloudinary gatsby-source-filesystem
```

```sh
yarn add gatsby-transformer-cloudinary gatsby-source-filesystem
```

## How to use

### Set up environment variables

Add the data that shouldn’t be committed to Git into `.env.development`:

```sh
# Find these values at https://cloudinary.com/console/
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your cloud name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your API key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your API secret>
```

> **NOTE:** you’ll also need to set these environment variables in your build system (i.e. Netlify).

### Configure the plugin

In your `gatsby-config.js`, point `gatsby-source-filesystem` to images in your app, then set up `gatsby-transformer-cloudinary` with your credentials.

```js
// Load the environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({
  path: `.env.${process.env.NODE_ENV}`,
});

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `images`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/images`,
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-transformer-cloudinary',
      options: {
        cloudName: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
        apiKey: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
        apiSecret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
        uploadFolder: 'gatsby-cloudinary',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

To directly upload images to Cloudinary from remote sources, you can use the `createRemoteImageNode` function:

```js
// gatsby-node.js
import { createRemoteImageNode } from 'gatsby-transformer-cloudinary';

// This example assumes "post" nodes are created in a `sourceNodes` function.
const POST_NODE_TYPE = 'post';

export async function onCreateNode({
  node,
  actions: { createNode },
  createNodeId,
  createContentDigest,
  reporter,
}) {
  // In this example, "post" nodes sometimes have a "cover_photo_url" that's a link to an image.
  if (node.internal.type === POST_NODE_TYPE && node.cover_photo_url) {
    await createRemoteImageNode({
      url: node.cover_photo_url,
      parentNode: node,
      relationshipName: 'coverPhoto',
      createNode,
      createNodeId,
      createContentDigest,
      reporter,
    });
  }
}
```

### Plugin options

In `gatsby-config.js` the plugin accepts the following options:

| option                     | type      | required | default value | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `fluidMinWidth`            | `Int`     | false    | 50            | The minimum width needed for an image. Used when calculating breakpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `createDerived`            | `Boolean` | false    | false         | If `true`, create and keep the derived images of the selected breakpoints during the API call. If false, images generated during the analysis process are thrown away. This option is ignored if `useCloudinaryBreakpoints` is `false`. It's recommended that you enable `createDerived` if `useCloudinaryBreakpoints` is true to store the breakpoint images and prevent them from being recalculated on every build. |
| `breakpointsMaxImages`     | `Integer` | false    | 20            | Set maximum number of responsive breakpoint images generated and returned on image upload. If `useCloudinaryBreakpoints` is false, then exactly `breakpointsMaxImages` breakpoints will be created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `useCloudinaryBreakpoints` | `Boolean` | false    | false         | If `true`, then Cloudinary will be requested to automatically find the best breakpoints for each image. It's recommended that this option be set to `false` in development because this option uses one Cloudinary transformation for every image uploaded to Cloudinary plus one transformation for every derived image created while calculating breakpoints.                                                        |
| `overwriteExisting`        | `Boolean` | false    | false         | Whether to overwrite existing assets with the same public ID. When set to false, return immediately if an asset with the same Public ID was found. It's recommended that this is set to false in development as each image overwrite costs one Cloudinary transformation.                                                                                                                                              |

> Note: Each derived image created for a breakpoint will consume one Cloudinary transformation. Enable the `useCloudinaryBreakpoints` option with care. If the `createDerived` option is enabled, transformations will only be consumed when the images are first created. However, created images will consume Cloudinary storage space. If `overwriteExisting` is enabled, each image that you upload will consume one transformation each time your Gatsby cache gets cleared and the image gets re-uploaded. For this reason, it's recommended that you keep `overWriteExisting` disabled and instead set the `overwriteExisting` parameter of `createRemoteImageNode` on a per-image basis when you know that an image has actually been updated.

### Query for images

Assuming you have an image called “avatar.jpg” in your `src/images/` directory, you can use it in a component like this:

```jsx harmony
import React from 'react';
import { graphql, useStaticQuery } from 'gatsby';
import Image from 'gatsby-image';

export default () => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      file(name: { eq: "avatar" }) {
        childCloudinaryAsset {
          fluid {
            ...CloudinaryAssetFluid
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  return <Image fluid={data.file.childCloudinaryAsset.fluid} alt="avatar" />;
};
```

## Manual Usage

It’s also possible to manually create `gatsby-image`-friendly `fixed` and `fluid` objects by importing helper functions from the transformer.

This is an advanced use case — if possible, try not to do this when Gatsby’s data layer is an option. This is intended for cases where assets are already on Cloudinary and moving them to the Gatsby project would be too time-intensive to be reasonable.

> **NOTE:** This approach is async, which means you’ll end up with content jumping unless you manually account for the image area. You’ve been warned.

### Manually creating fluid images

```js
import React from 'react';
import Image from 'gatsby-image';
import { getFluidImageObject } from 'gatsby-transformer-cloudinary';

export default () => {
  const [fluid, setFluid] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    getFluidImageObject({
      public_id: 'gatsby-cloudinary/jason',
      cloudName: 'jlengstorf',
      originalHeight: 3024,
      originalWidth: 4032,
      breakpoints: [200, 400, 600, 800],
      transformations: ['ar_16:10', 'c_fill'],
      chained: ['e_grayscale,e_tint:100:663399:0p:white:100p', 't_lwj'],
    }).then(result => setFluid(result));
  }, []);

  return fluid ? <Image fluid={fluid} alt="Jason" /> : <p>loading...</p>;
};
```

### Manually creating fixed images

```js
import React from 'react';
import Image from 'gatsby-image';
import { getFixedImageObject } from 'gatsby-transformer-cloudinary';

export default () => {
  const [fixed, setFixed] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    getFixedImageObject({
      public_id: 'gatsby-cloudinary/jason',
      cloudName: 'jlengstorf',
      originalHeight: 3024,
      originalWidth: 4032,
    }).then(result => setFixed(result));
  }, []);

  return fixed ? <Image fixed={fixed} alt="Jason" /> : <p>loading...</p>;
};
```

## API

This plugin can support both the `fixed` and `fluid` formats for `gatsby-image`.

Both `fixed` and `fluid` accept arguments. All arguments are optional.

| ---------- | ----- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `maxWidth` | `Int` | Original width of the image | The maximum width for fluid images. |

### A note about aspect ratios

You’re able to change the aspect ratio of images by supplying the [aspect ratio parameter](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformation_reference#aspect_ratio_parameter) in the `transformations` argument.

> **NOTE:** The aspect ratio _must_ be supplied in the `transformations` array. It **will not** be picked up from the `chained` argument.
